### Week 9: Boolean Combination of Invariants
**Deliverables:**
- Extend the synthesis tool to generate boolean combinations of linear invariants
- Support invariants of the form: (ax + by ≤ c) ∧ (dx + ey ≤ f) ∨ (gx + hy ≤ i)
- Test against benchmark problems requiring boolean combinations
- Submit: Extended synthesis tool with boolean invariant support
